## 🎯 **Token ID System Explained:**

### **How It Works:**
```
First NFT minted  → Token ID: 0
Second NFT minted → Token ID: 1  
Third NFT minted  → Token ID: 2
And so on...
```

### **Your Current NFTs:**
Based on the status check, you currently own:
- **NFT #1** (Token ID: 1)

### **If You Mint 5 More NFTs:**
You would own:
- **NFT #1** (existing)
- **NFT #2** (new)
- **NFT #3** (new)
- **NFT #4** (new)
- **NFT #5** (new)
- **NFT #6** (new)

**The UI will show all of them and let you choose which to send!**

## 🔍 **Visual Guide:**

### **Before (Confusing):**
```
❌ Enter Token ID: [____] ← You had to guess!
❌ Enter Chain ID: [____] ← You had to remember!
```

### **After (User-Friendly):**
```
✅ Your NFTs: You own 3 NFTs: #1, #3, #5
✅ Select NFT: [Dropdown showing: NFT #1, NFT #3, NFT #5]
✅ Destination: [Dropdown showing: Sepolia Testnet]
```
